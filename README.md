- 👋 Hi, I’m Sarath
- 👀 I’m interested in learning something new.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
    Languages: JS, Typescript, React, Shell, Go and Python, to name a few.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment as I have a tight schedule.
- 📫 How to reach me - well drop me a mail.
